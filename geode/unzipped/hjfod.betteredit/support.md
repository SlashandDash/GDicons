
BetterEdit is first and foremost <cy>a passion project</c>, but if you would like to support development, I have a Ko-fi!

I'm also planning on making a <cb>paid Pro version</c> in the future with some cool extra features :)

However, please <cr>don't donate just for the purpose of getting Pro</c>! While I fully intended to make it, I know from past experience that something might come in the way, and <cr>I do not want to receive money for a product until I can guarantee it exists</c>.

## <cy>Do not donate any money you need yourself</c>.

I don't want starving students to give me their last pennies! Take care of yourself first!
