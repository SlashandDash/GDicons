# Advanced Song Preview

Play locally downloaded songs with their waveforms and an easy ui for picking a start offset.

Waveform code based off [config's code for his 2.1 mod](https://github.com/cgytrus/EditorWaveform). Thanks config boy

To use this mod, go into the editor and press play when picking a custom song. There you can
seek the song by clicking on the waveform, and pick a start offset by dragging the cursor on top.

## TODO:
- [X] Actually be able to type in the start offset input
- [X] Add song title to popup
- [ ] Design custom button for seek to start offset
- [ ] Clean up code
