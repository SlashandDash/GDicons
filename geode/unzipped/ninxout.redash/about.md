# Special thanks to:
- [Brift](https://twitter.com/BriftXD), for making the original concept, as well as providing me the textures.
- [ninXout](https://github.com/ninXout), for writing the baseline of the mod so I could have an easier time continuing the work.
- [The GD Modding server](https://discord.gg/gd-modding-822510988409831486), for providing feedbacks and bug reports during the mod's development.
- [GD-Roulette](mod:spaghettdev.gd-roulette), [GDDP Integration](mod:minemaker0430.gddp_integration) and [Super Expert](mod:xanii.super_expert) for the sprites that we forcefully stole for compatibilities :D.
- [Level Thumbnails](mod:cdc.level_thumbnails), because I pretty much copied its code and used its thumbnail hosting github for the thumbnails of the timely levels.
