# EndscreenTweaks

Various tweaks to the endscreen. (Formerly WholesomeEndTexts.)

Features:
* Showing attempt and jump counts in platformer levels.
* Auto-hiding the endscreen on level completion (unfortunately, the gray background still persists.)
* Hiding the chains or background from the endscreen
* Enabling the bouncing transition, even if "Fast Menu" from ingame is disabled.
* Changing the font of the "Level Complete" text message.
* Various checks to ensure compatibility with other mods that modify the endscreen

And now, for the big one...

Replaces "Level Complete" texts with wholesome ones, including those of your own choice. The antithesis of DisturbingNewBests.

Allows three sets of messages: a default set, custom text from the config folder, and Technoblade quotes.

Also comes with other customization options for the "Level Complete" screen, including an option to show attempts and jumps on platformer levels.

Custom messages defined from the `custom.txt` file within the mod's config directory will be formatted as follows: `- lorem ipsum -` in order to distinguish them from the default set of messages. As tempting as it would be to have a regex filter to moderate messages found in `custom.txt`, this mod will not be pulling double duty by attempting to solve the Scunthorpe problem.

Quotes originated from a variety of sources, including various members of the Geode SDK Discord server, variations of comments from level ID 64760396 that didn't make it to update 2.2, Ted Lasso on Apple TV+, and Technoblade.

This mod supersedes past copies of both Relative's Custom Endscreen Text mod and my WholesomeEndTexts mod from the old index.
