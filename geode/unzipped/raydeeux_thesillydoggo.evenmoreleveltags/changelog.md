# EvenMoreLevelTags Changelog
## v1.3.2
- Changed function hooks to minimize crashes.
- Port to 2.206. Big thanks to CatXus, Aktimoose, ninXout, and hiimjustin000 for helping out with testing!
- Added softtoggle.
- By default, tags will not show up when viewing levels published under the RobsVault account due to technical constraints. (This was not the case in earlier versions of this mod.)
- Added macOS support, which may be unstable. In case this mod consistently crashes on macOS, support for it will be dropped in future updates (hence the softtoggle).

- Fix a few visual bugs and other things that weren't caught the first time around. 
## v1.3.0

- Change mod ID, so that Globed's incompatibility list stays the same.
- Bump minimum Geode version and Geode Node ID requirements.
- Added more level tags (check the `about.md` for more info).
